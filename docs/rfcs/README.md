# OmniGraph RFCs

RFCs are durable decision records for changes that are costly to reverse or
wide enough that implementation review alone cannot establish the right shape.
All formal RFCs live in this directory and use one lifecycle, one metadata
schema, and one number namespace. `track` records where a proposal came from;
it does not change the review or acceptance rules.

The architectural invariants remain the hard boundary for every change. An RFC
explains why a particular design is worth its long-term liability and records
the evidence behind the decision; it cannot waive
[the invariants or deny-list](../dev/invariants.md).

## When an RFC is required

Write an RFC before implementing:

- a new query, schema, CLI, HTTP, or SDK contract;
- an on-disk format, wire format, recovery protocol, or compatibility change;
- a new storage substrate or dependency that constrains future architecture;
- a cross-cutting correctness, authorization, or operational boundary; or
- an exception to a deny-list item or another hard-to-reverse choice.

Routine bug fixes, narrow refactors, dependency maintenance, and documentation
corrections normally do not need an RFC. If the code can land safely and be
reverted cheaply without committing the project to a lasting contract, an
issue and implementation PR are usually enough.

## File and heading format

- Filename: `NNNN-kebab-title.md`.
- Heading: `# RFC NNNN: Title`.
- Reference labels use `RFC NNNN` and point to the canonical RFC filename.
- `0000-template.md` is reserved and is not an RFC.
- Allocate the number only when adding the RFC file. Numbers are never reused
  or backfilled, including numbers from rejected, superseded, abandoned, or
  out-of-tree drafts.
- Do not create `pre-merge`, `final`, `v2`, `internal`, or review-ledger copies.
  Revise the canonical file; preserve meaningful changes in its decision log.

The next available number is **0064**; lower gaps are historical and must
not be reused (0050 is allocated by the `rfc/0050-engine-crate-topology`
branch; 0056 by PR #670; 0058 by PR #662 for retained merged ancestry;
0059 by PR #675; 0060 by PR #677).

## Required frontmatter

Every RFC uses exactly this schema:

```yaml
---
rfc: "0042"
title: "Short descriptive title"
track: maintainer
status: draft
implementation: not-started
authors:
  - Name or handle
created: 2026-08-23
updated: 2026-08-23
discussion: null
supersedes: []
superseded_by: []
blocked_on: []
---
```

Field rules:

- `rfc` is the four-digit string from the filename and heading.
- `title` matches the heading text.
- `track` is `public` or `maintainer`; both follow the same lifecycle.
- `status` is one of `draft`, `accepted`, `rejected`, or `superseded`.
- `implementation` is one of `not-started`, `in-progress`, `partial`,
  `complete`, `removed`, or `n/a`.
- `authors` is a non-empty list.
- `created` and `updated` use `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `discussion` is a durable issue/PR URL or `null`.
- `supersedes` and `superseded_by` contain four-digit RFC strings. Update both
  sides when the relationship applies to the whole decision.
- `blocked_on` contains concrete evidence or dependency gates. Research being
  blocked is not a lifecycle status; it is a draft with a non-empty list.

Frontmatter is the only status and date authority. Do not repeat it in a table
or a hand-written `Status`, `Date`, `Author track`, or `Implementation` field.
The body may contain a dated disposition or implementation note when it adds
context rather than restating metadata.

## Lifecycle

```text
draft ──maintainer decision──▶ accepted ──later replacement──▶ superseded
  │                                  │
  └──maintainer decision──▶ rejected └──implementation progresses separately
```

- **Draft**: under design and review. A draft may live on the main branch so
  review and evidence have one durable home, but merge alone does not accept
  it. Product behavior must not claim authority from a draft.
- **Accepted**: maintainers approved the decision and its stated boundaries.
  Implementation status moves independently as work lands.
- **Rejected**: the decision was not adopted. Keep the record and concise
  rationale; use `removed` if an experiment shipped and was later deleted,
  otherwise `n/a` or `not-started` as appropriate.
- **Superseded**: another RFC owns the current decision. Link both directions
  and keep the old rationale intact.

Acceptance requires all invariants, compatibility consequences, operational
boundaries, and owned evidence gates to be explicit. A blocker owned by another
RFC does not block an independently reviewable decision, but hidden shared
dependencies do.

## Process

1. Copy [the template](0000-template.md) to the next available number.
2. Set every frontmatter field and open a PR in `draft` status.
3. Review the problem, user/operational behavior, invariants, substrate
   alignment, compatibility, evidence, alternatives, and rollout.
4. Record material review outcomes in the RFC's decision log. Do not maintain a
   separate review ledger. A post-merge amendment rewrites the body sentences
   it changes and its Decision-log entry names each sentence it supersedes, so
   the body alone stays current.
5. A maintainer decision changes the lifecycle to `accepted` or `rejected`.
6. Implementation PRs link the accepted RFC and update `implementation` plus
   any durable evidence or support boundary in the canonical file.
7. A later incompatible decision gets a new RFC and supersedes the old one.

For Lance-dependent work, follow [the Lance reading protocol](../dev/lance.md)
and record the exact upstream version and surfaces reviewed. For test planning,
extend existing owners according to [the test map](../dev/testing.md).
