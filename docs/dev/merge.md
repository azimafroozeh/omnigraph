# Branch merge

**Audience:** engine contributors
**Authority:** current merge routes and invariants; public conflict behavior is
in [the user merge guide](../user/branching/merge.md)

`Omnigraph::branch_merge` performs a graph-level three-way merge from the
source branch into a target branch. The merge base, source, and target are
resolved once; final publication revalidates their exact graph and native-ref
identities.

## Per-table decision

For every table lifetime present in the accepted catalogs, merge compares:

- the table visible at the merge base;
- the source result;
- the current target result.

Stable table/incarnation identity decides whether entries belong to the same
lifetime. Aliases and paths are not merge identity. A rename preserves a
lifetime; drop/re-add is a different declaration even if the name is reused.

The table classifier chooses one of four routes:

1. **No change:** source contributes nothing.
2. **Pointer adoption:** target still equals the base and the exact source table
   state can become the target's visible pointer without copying rows. A
   first-touch lazy target can use this ref-only route when the version check
   below permits it.
3. **Proven insertion replay:** target still permits data replay and the
   complete retained source interval proves a contiguous sequence of exact-ID,
   insertion-only transactions.
4. **General ordered merge:** stream base/source/target in logical `id` order,
   classify each row, and stage the selected delta.

An optimization miss is not a merge failure. Missing transaction history,
unknown certificate fields, incomplete ancestry, or an unfamiliar Lance shape
falls back to the general route.

Native Lance version numbers are local to each native branch. The manifest
projection nevertheless selects the highest registered version for a table
lifetime, so adopting a source version less than or equal to the target's
version cannot safely replace its pointer. A nonempty source delta uses the
target-lineage writer, creating a native target ref lazily when needed. A
proved empty delta retains the target's complete table entry, including its
native ref and version metadata. The version comparison selects the
publication route; it never proves row equality. This rule also governs Blob
preflight so validation and publication agree on which rows are copied, which
means a `main`-to-branch adoption that carries Blob payloads is subject to the
keyed-write byte cap like any other delta. The proven insertion replay never
applies to this shape: the proof needs a source version above the base, and
the base equals the target here, so the delta is computed by the ordered walk
even when it turns out empty.

This comparison is a fence, not the class fix: the projection and the
registry guard order registrations by the native version number, a
per-branch counter, and the same comparison produced #473 and the projection
miss this rule works around. Ordering registrations by the `__manifest`
version that published them (unique and increasing within every branch's
lineage, which is the only scope the projection ever compares) would retire
the rule.

## Proven insertion route

The internal `omnigraph.insert_absence = "v1"` transaction property says that
the filtered physical IDs were proven absent from that transaction's effective
parent. Merge accepts it only when every version in the complete source
interval is present and structurally proves:

- one exact previous-version link and transaction UUID;
- an insertion-only filtered Update over exactly physical `id`;
- no removed/updated fragments or unrelated maintenance effect;
- complete nested schema/index-coverage metadata;
- physical-row totals matching the manifest delta;
- exact source and target native branch incarnations under the final gates.

The route stages bounded immutable fragments, then commits the same certified
filter-bearing Update shape. It performs no target MergeInsert join or target
ID preflight. The marker is not a signature and raw Lance writers remain
unsupported. RFC 0023 owns the detailed proof and performance evidence.

## General route

The fallback is an ordered three-way cursor merge. Each cursor streams one
snapshot's rows in `id` order in two phases so no payload column ever reaches
a SortExec input:

- a narrow ordered scan sorts only `id` + `_rowid` + `_rowaddr` (8,192 rows
  and 32 MiB per decoded batch as targets — a few dozen bytes per sorted row);
- sorted keys are hydrated back into complete rows in bounded chunks through
  an unordered, fragment-scoped scan filtered to the chunk's exact `_rowaddr`
  set against the same pinned dataset. Every retained batch is compacted and
  hard-charged as it streams; a chunk that crosses the 64 MiB retained
  ceiling is dropped mid-stream and retried with half the rows, so peak
  hydration memory is the ceiling plus one in-flight scanner batch for any
  row-width shape — the width estimate that plans chunk sizes only reduces
  retries, it is never load-bearing for the bound. A single indivisible row
  wider than the ceiling still hydrates alone;
- Blob columns hydrate as descriptors; Blob-bearing rows are materialized
  under the same operation budget;
- all selected constructive rows stage as upserts and removals as deletes;
- the transaction plan is pre-minted and bounded before recovery arm;
- selected validation deltas share one operation-wide memory budget.

Logical conflicts are computed before effects. Value constraints, uniqueness,
referential integrity, and cardinality run through the shared validator against
the target plus the complete selected delta.

## Cost model

Route selection determines the cost class. For one table, let `N` be the live
rows in an input image, `delta` the selected rows, `K` the retained source
versions, and `C` the bounded publish chunks.

| Route | Classification | Publication |
|---|---|---|
| Pointer adoption | Metadata-only when no validation delta is needed; otherwise the delta may require base/source ordered scans | Native-ref or manifest-pointer change; no row copy |
| Proven insertion replay | Walk `K <= 1,024` transaction records and scan only the certified source interval | `C <= 1,024` join-free fenced inserts; no target ID preflight or MergeInsert join |
| Adopt with delta | At least two full ordered scans, base and source | New rows use preflighted fenced inserts; changed rows use update-only `KnownPresentUpdate`; deletes are chunked |
| General three-way | At least three full ordered scans, base, source, and target | Constructive rows use insertion-capable upsert; deletes are chunked |

Insertion-capable upsert forces Lance's v2 path (`use_index(false)`) so the
transaction carries the exact-`id` conflict filter. Each constructive chunk
may therefore join the full target. `KnownPresentUpdate` can use an `id` index
when its coverage is safe, falls back to the full join otherwise, and never
inserts.

Every ordered cursor asks Lance to sort the full table by logical `id`. The
sort is `O(N log N)` and consumes all input before producing its first row. An
`id` BTREE accelerates filters but does not provide ordered enumeration, so it
does not remove this sort. Only the narrow key projection enters the sort;
payload columns (vectors, wide strings, Blob descriptors) are read once through
the bounded hydration takes, so row width raises hydration read cost but not
sort or spill cost, and a pre-existing wide row cannot fail an unrelated
merge at the sort's single-row cap.

Ordered scans run in a bounded spill context: each execution has a 150 MiB
memory pool, a 100 GiB scratch quota, and a 37.5 MiB cap on the batches fed
into a sort. If spilling is disabled, the scratch quota is exhausted, or an
indivisible row exceeds the hard cap, merge fails loudly; it never returns a
partial result. A hard-cap failure reports the byte count Lance measured (the
`limit + 1` sentinel survives only for an unparseable upstream message), and
cursor-context failures name the table and base/source/target snapshot role.
The 8,192-row and 32 MiB scanner settings are batch targets, not hard
decoded-batch limits.

Validation is delta-scoped and retains at most 32 MiB of projected scalar
state. Usable physical indexes reduce uniqueness and relationship probe cost;
missing coverage falls back to scans without changing correctness. Tables and
chunks publish sequentially inside the one recovery envelope, and all routes
defer index construction to reconciliation.

Cost tests cap common fast-forward manifest opens/scans at three and diverged
merges at four. Each scan still folds the surviving append-only `__manifest`
history, so tiny merges can slow down on an uncompacted graph; `optimize` is
the operational remedy.

## Diagnosing a slow merge

`MergeWriteProbes` is a task-local test and benchmark seam; production leaves
it unset, so timing does not read the clock. Its top-level timing flow is:

`OuterPrepare` -> ((`ProvenInsertHistory` -> `ProvenInsertPlanScan`) | `TableWalk`)
-> `CandidateValidation` -> `FinalRevalidation` -> `RecoveryArm` ->
`PhysicalPublish` -> `RecoveryConfirm` -> `ManifestPublish` -> `RecoveryCleanup`
-> `OuterRestoreRefresh`.

The parenthesized classification routes are chosen per table, so a mixed-table
operation can record both route families. `TableWalk` covers one general
three-way ordered walk and merged-row staging; for Blob tables it begins after
the operation-wide descriptor preflight. `KeyedStage` and `KeyedCommit` are
sub-buckets of `PhysicalPublish`.
`merge_timing_snapshot` reports total, maximum, and exact interval count for
every phase; the count remains meaningful when a short duration rounds down to
zero microseconds. Structural probes identify the chosen data path. The columns
below correspond to
`ordered_cursor_scan_calls`, `stage_fenced_insert_calls`,
`stage_known_present_update_calls`, `stage_merge_insert_calls`, and
`strict_insert_preflight_calls`:

| Route | Ordered cursors | Fenced inserts | Known-present updates | MergeInsert upserts | Strict-insert preflights |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Proven insertion replay | `0` | `C` | `0` | `0` | `0` |
| Adopt with delta | at least `2` | insert chunks | changed-row chunks | `0` | insert chunks |
| General three-way | at least `3` | `0` | `0` | constructive-row chunks | `0` |

Blob descriptor selection can add cursor passes, so the fallback counts are
lower bounds. Other useful signals are:

- high `ProvenInsertHistory` means the retained transaction walk dominates;
- high `ProvenInsertPlanScan` means scanning or materializing the certified
  source interval dominates;
- any ordered cursor on an insert-only merge means the provenance proof missed
  and classification fell back;
- high `KeyedStage` means target lookup/join or Blob materialization dominates;
- high `ManifestPublish` with a tiny delta points to manifest history or CAS
  retries;
- validation projected-byte counters expose pressure on the 32 MiB delta
  budget, while Blob payload and external-probe counters isolate object cost.

The probe set also records requested cursor batch bounds, raw proven-insert
batch sizes, and legacy whole-delta scans. `stage_vector_index_calls` and
`scan_staged_combined_calls` should remain zero on current merge routes.

## Conflicts

The engine reports structured conflict kinds:

- `DivergentInsert`
- `DivergentUpdate`
- `DeleteVsUpdate`
- `OrphanEdge`
- `UniqueViolation`
- `CardinalityViolation`
- `ValueConstraintViolation`

Conflict detection never silently picks a winner. The HTTP layer maps the
structured result to its public 409 representation.

## Publication and recovery

All productive table routes feed one BranchMerge recovery sidecar. Pointer
changes, table effects, target authority, and pre-minted graph lineage are fixed
before the first effect. The target becomes visible through one manifest CAS.

After recovery arm, a failed table link or publish retains recovery ownership
and returns `RecoveryRequired`. Merge does not re-run semantic classification
around a committed prefix. Full recovery either publishes the complete
confirmed result or compensates the owned partial set before visibility.

## Outcomes

`MergeOutcome` is one of:

- `AlreadyUpToDate` — source adds no target-visible change;
- `FastForward` — the target adopts source state without a divergent
  three-way result;
- `Merged` — a productive three-way merge publishes a new graph commit.
